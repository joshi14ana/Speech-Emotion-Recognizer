# Speech-Emotion-Recognizer
As humans, interacting with people through speech is one of the most natural ways to express ourselves. We rely so much on our emotions that we donâ€™t even realise that for most humans non verbal cues such as pitch, loudness and rate of speech are efficient carriers of emotions. So, with increasing autonomous  technology, it is crucial for robots to understand human emotions such as to interact more effectively. 
Speech Emotion Recognition, abbreviated as SER, is a technology that extracts emotional features from speech signals by computer and contrasts and analyses the characteristic parameters and the emotional change acquired.
SER has entered so many areas these years, including:
The medical field: In the world of telemedicine the ability for a medical professional to discern what the patient is actually feeling can be useful in the healing process.
Customer service: In call center conversation may be used to analyze behavioral study of call attendants with the customers which helps to improve the quality of service.
Recommender systems: Can be useful to recommend products to customers based on their emotion towards that product.
